\paragraph{Perception vs Language}

Perception is to understand the world through signals. Understanding
is recursive, because you only understand in respect to something
else. When does it stop? 

Perception is a set of algorithms that are operating on a system. What
do they do? The experts can't agree.

David Marr said the goal of perception is to assign labels to objects
in the data. Lead to the field of Computer Vision. This hasn't gone anywhere because there's no interaction with the world.

Difference bewteen perception and understanding: human can perceive
and relate the situation with a set of symbols in his head (the goat,
monkey, ed, tom and the mars bar).

We may never know how animals perceive the world, the contexted needed
to relate with the world. 

Use language to relate things in the world, as well as the nature of
those representations (of signals)

\paragraph{The Cognitive Dialogue}

Query using a lexicon to a vision system. The vision system answers
the query i.e. ``is there a car?'', then the lexicon searches for more
hypotheses. 
Can apply this dialog to any problem, so this is a ( general model for
intelligence
Perception cannot start bottomw up..
log-polar space normalizes the space so that it's scale invariant

\textbf{Concepts}: An apple is a concept, we don't have a memory of a
specific apple. It's like an idea.
